## Sharon’s Encounters with God’s Heart

From childhood, Sharon experienced supernatural moments. At just 13, she nearly drowned — but instead of fear, she felt warmth, peace, and was surrounded by a soft, glowing light. That light, she came to understand, was God’s presence.

Years later, during a dark period, Jesus Himself appeared to her with these comforting words:

> *“I love you. I’m with you. Don’t be afraid.”*

That moment ended her suicidal thoughts and led her deeper into her faith journey. She would later witness miraculous healing and feel God's nearness even in silence.

## A Glimpse into Heaven

Her most vivid near-death experience occurred after being struck by lightning. Sharon described her spirit lifting from her body and entering a realm more real than earth — filled with color, music, and divine presence.

### What she saw:

- A **garden of peace** where she met her two brothers (who had died as infants)
- A **city of light** with homes, a golden-domed temple, and a divine library
- **Healing pools** for souls transitioning from traumatic deaths
- A **life review** filled with love, not shame — no judgment, only truth
- A **Book of Life** containing every soul’s purpose and journey
- Even her childhood dog, alive and joyful in this radiant realm

She learned heaven isn’t far — it’s simply hidden by a spiritual veil. God’s love filled every corner, every sound, even the colors.

## God Cares About Love, Not Religion

Sharon was told:

> *“Every religion holds a piece of truth, like stained glass. But love is the light that shines through it.”*

God didn’t ask her about church attendance, theology, or possessions. He asked how much she had **loved**.

Her encounters revealed that:

- Heaven is built on relationship, not religion
- **Every small act of love matters eternally**
- Our souls are eternal, radiant, and deeply known by God

## A Message from Jesus: Just Love

In one final moment, while caring for her ailing mother, Jesus told her:

> *“Everything that’s happened in your life has prepared you for this. Just love. That’s all you have to do — just love.”*

He also gave her tools to discern spirits: those filled with darkness bring fear and pride. Those from God bring light, peace, and joy.

## Biblical Echoes

Sharon’s experience mirrors powerful truths from Scripture:

> *“He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”*  
> — 1 John 4:8 (KJV)

> *“Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”*  
> — Galatians 6:7 (KJV)

> *“I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”*  
> — Psalm 139:14 (KJV)

## A Prayer and Invitation

> **Heavenly Father**,  
> Thank You for Your boundless, unconditional love. Thank You for reminding us that what matters most is how we love others. Help us to surrender every burden and reflect Your goodness in all we do.  
> Fill our hearts with the simplicity of Your truth. May we see through spiritual eyes and radiate love in every word and action.  
> In Jesus’ name, Amen.
