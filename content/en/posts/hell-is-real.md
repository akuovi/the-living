# Is Hell Real?  
## Bill Wiese’s ‘23 Minutes in Hell’ Vision Explained Through Scripture

{{< /brick_title >}}

{{< brick_wide >}}

Friends, I recently had the profound opportunity to listen to Bill Wiese share his sobering testimony, *23 Minutes in Hell*. This message is more than just a story — it’s a spiritual wake-up call grounded in Scripture. In a time when eternity is often downplayed, even within the Church, Bill’s vision reminds us of the gravity of our salvation and the reality of eternal separation from God.

## The Unimaginable Reality of Hell

Bill described being placed in a prison-like cell deep within the earth — a place the Bible refers to as Sheol or Hades. He emphasized that it wasn’t a dream or near-death experience but a divinely appointed vision, similar to those experienced by prophets like Paul and Ezekiel.

### What he experienced:

- **Physical Agony**: Despite being in a spirit body, he felt real pain. Every movement was difficult, as if all strength had vanished.
- **Extreme Heat & Fire**: Literal flames raged through a cavernous pit. The heat was unbearable, like standing in a blast furnace.
- **Absolute Darkness**: A darkness that could be felt — not just physical but spiritual and evil in nature.
- **Foul Odors**: The air was thick with sulfur, decay, and death — each breath was torment.
- **Demonic Tormentors**: Reptilian, monstrous beings 12–13 feet tall attacked with hatred and power, tearing and mocking without mercy.
- **Isolation & Hopelessness**: Though surrounded by screams, he was utterly alone — no comfort, no contact, no escape.
- **Maggots & Worms**: They covered the ground, feeding on flesh that regenerated so the torment could continue.

He said this wasn’t God’s punishment — it was the absence of God's goodness. Light, peace, joy, love — all gone. Hell was never meant for humans but for Satan and his angels. We choose it only by rejecting Jesus.

## A Wake-Up Call for Believers

Bill’s testimony is a serious reminder: salvation is not casual. If you’ve been rescued by Christ, reflect on what you’ve been saved *from*. Hell is real — and so is the mercy that spares us.

His story challenges us:

- To appreciate the cost of salvation  
- To live in holiness  
- To love others enough to speak the truth in grace

He shared an illustration from William Booth: a stormy sea of drowning souls, with only a few on the Rock pulling people to safety. Too many of us are on that Rock, living comfortably, forgetting the waves of the lost.

## The Gospel Is Urgent

> *“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:  
> no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”*  
> — John 14:6 (KJV)

No matter how “good” someone is, salvation isn’t by merit — it’s by faith in Jesus alone. God is holy and just, but also loving and patient. He made a way so none should perish.

But the choice is ours.

## A Prayer and a Call to Reflection

> Dear God in Heaven,  
> We come before You with humble hearts, awed by Your immense love and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.  
> Thank You for revealing the truth of eternity and saving us from unimaginable torment.  
> Forgive us for complacency.  
> Fill us with Your Spirit.  
> Set a fire in us for the lost.  
> Help us speak with courage, live with holiness, and walk in love.  
> May our lives reflect the grace You so freely gave.  
> In Jesus' name, Amen.
