# God's Mercy Is Bigger

Let me share something deeply personal with you today.

Back in 2017, I stumbled across a video on YouTube that completely wrecked me—in the best possible way. It was an interview with Jim Caviezel, the actor who played Jesus in *The Passion of the Christ*.

At first, I was just curious to hear behind-the-scenes stories about making such a famous film. But what Jim shared went far beyond acting. He talked about his faith, about suffering, and about the cost of following Jesus. And then he said something that cut me to my core.

Toward the end of his testimony, Jim spoke directly about sins like abortion and adultery.

He didn’t sugarcoat the truth. He said these things are serious sins because they go against God’s design and hurt people deeply. But he also made something incredibly clear: **no matter how big our sins are, God’s mercy is even bigger.**

Jim shared that many people hide their deepest mistakes because they fear judgment. He pointed out how we often choose to share our secrets with a trusted friend, because we believe that friend will still love us. But he challenged us with this question: *If our friends can show us mercy and love, how much more can God?*

That truth hit me hard.

When Jim talked about adultery, it felt like he was speaking straight to me. I remember sitting there watching this video, and I literally cried for over an hour.

At that time, I had been living an adulterous lifestyle. I knew it was wrong, but I didn’t know how to come out of it. I was blind, so to speak. But I believe the Holy Spirit used Jim’s words to convict me of my sin.

Hearing Jim say that God loves us and wants none of us to perish broke me in the best way. In those tears, it felt like God was washing me clean, lifting a weight off my shoulders that I’d carried for so long.

Jim also shared another powerful truth: **God doesn’t send people to hell—people choose to reject Him.** God wants everyone to come home to Him, no matter how far they’ve fallen. He’s always ready to forgive, but it requires us to turn back to Him and say “yes.”

And Jim explained that heaven isn’t just something waiting for us after we die. He said we can start experiencing God’s peace and presence right now, even in the middle of our mess.

After that day, something changed inside me. I felt peace and joy like I hadn’t known in years. And now, even though it’s been years since 2017, I’m finally writing this because I don’t want anyone else to stay stuck in sin the way I was.

I want you to know this: **God loves you. He wants you free. He wants you close to Him.**

You are unique. There’s no one else like you. God created you on purpose, and He would miss you if you were gone.

We’re not perfect. We all fall short. But it’s only by His grace that we’re saved—and He’s waiting for us to turn to Him.

If you’ve ever struggled with sin, guilt, shame, or just feel far from God, please believe me when I say this: **God’s mercy and forgiveness are real. I know, because I’m living proof.**

### A Short Prayer

> Lord Jesus, thank You for loving us even in our failures. Thank You for washing us clean and giving us new life. Help us walk in Your truth and grace every day. Amen.
