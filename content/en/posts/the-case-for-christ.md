## Historical Evidence for Jesus

This video presents the journey of Lee Strobel, a former atheist and Chicago Tribune investigative journalist, who set out to disprove Christianity. Motivated by his wife‚Äôs newfound faith, Strobel began investigating the historical claims about Jesus using rigorous journalistic and legal criteria.

His findings included:

- **Gospel reliability:** The New Testament gospels are the earliest, most credible accounts of Jesus‚Äô life.
- **Eyewitness testimony:** Rooted in first-hand accounts from disciples and contemporaries.
- **Early composition:** Written when eyewitnesses were still alive, allowing scrutiny.
- **Cultural context:** Oral tradition in Jewish culture was rigorously preserved.
- **Manuscript evidence:** Far surpasses any other ancient work in number and consistency.
- **External corroboration:** Historians like Josephus and Tacitus confirm key gospel events.
- **Unvarnished narratives:** Women were first witnesses of the resurrection‚Äîa culturally inconvenient truth.
- **Radical transformation:** Apostles risked and gave their lives for their testimony.

Ultimately, Strobel concluded:  
> *‚ÄúIt would take more faith to maintain my atheism than to become a Christian.‚Äù*

## Devotional Reflection

Strobel‚Äôs journey reminds us that **faith is not opposed to reason**, but often built upon it. Investigating the historical Jesus with intellectual honesty can strengthen our confidence in the truth of the gospel.

What struck many‚Äîincluding Strobel‚Äîwas that the gospel writers didn‚Äôt try to sanitize the narrative: women were the first witnesses of the resurrection (a culturally inconvenient detail), and the apostles frequently appear confused or fearful. Such transparency supports the documents‚Äô credibility.

We are invited to do as Strobel did: to question deeply, explore honestly, and follow the evidence wherever it leads.
