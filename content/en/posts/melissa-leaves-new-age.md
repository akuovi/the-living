# I Didn’t Know I Was a Witch  
## How Melissa Found Jesus and Left the New Age

{{< /brick_title >}}

{{< brick_wide >}}

Have you ever felt like you were searching for *something* but could never find it? That’s exactly how Melissa felt.

She grew up bouncing between churches — Catholic, Mormon, Lutheran — but always felt a hole in her heart. As she got older, she started exploring stuff like astrology, tarot readings, energy healing, and even talking to “spirit guides.”

At first, it felt cool and “spiritual.” She thought she was helping people and even believed she was doing God’s work. But behind the crystals and meditation music, darkness started creeping in.

Melissa started having wild supernatural experiences — hearing voices, seeing strange things at night, and feeling attacked spiritually. She realized that those so-called “spirit guides” were actually demons pretending to be good.

> “I thought I was doing God’s work, but I was a witch and didn’t even know it,” Melissa shared in her interview.

Eventually, her life fell apart. She ended up in the hospital with pneumonia, feeling like she was dying. In desperation, she cried out to Jesus and promised she’d leave the New Age if He saved her.

God showed up in a powerful way. Melissa recovered and began clearing her house of every crystal, tarot card, and spiritual tool she owned. She turned her life completely over to Jesus — and found the real peace and love she’d been searching for all along.

Melissa’s story is a huge reminder that spiritual deception is real. Just because something looks “light” or “positive” doesn’t mean it’s from God. The Bible says:

> *“Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.”* (2 Corinthians 11:14)

## Demons Don’t Always Sound Nice

One of the ways Melissa knew her “spirit guide” wasn’t really from God was because of the way it talked.

Even though it pretended to be loving and spiritual, it would suddenly say racist things or start cursing.

> Melissa shared: *“My spirit guide… would say racist stuff and I'd be like, why are you saying racist stuff? … And it would say ‘Oh, you know nothing, it’s just a joke.’”*

Melissa realized:

- Demons might talk sweet and “spiritual” at first.  
- But their true nature eventually shows through anger, hate, lies, and foul language.

It was a huge clue for her that these beings weren’t angels from God at all.

## The Lies Demons Tell Us

One of the biggest things Melissa discovered is that demons love to lie to us.

They whisper things like:

- “You’re worthless.”  
- “You’ll never change.”  
- “You have special powers — you’re meant to be a psychic or witch.”  
- “You’ve lived past lives, and your destiny is connected to ancient spirits.”  
- “God doesn’t really love you.”  
- “The Bible is outdated — you need hidden knowledge.”

These lies are designed to:

- Pull us away from Jesus.  
- Keep us trapped in fear, confusion, and pride.  
- Make us chase spiritual experiences instead of God Himself.

Melissa realized that the “spirit guide” she thought loved her was actually a demon feeding her lies.

The truth is:

- Jesus loves you.  
- You have a new identity in Him.  
- You don’t need spiritual secrets or rituals — only a relationship with Jesus.

## A Short Prayer for Deliverance

If you’re feeling trapped in New Age practices or witchcraft, or you’re not sure where you stand spiritually, here’s a simple prayer you can pray right now:

> **“Jesus, I confess that I’ve been involved in things that are not from You. I turn away from every practice that’s not of God. I believe You died on the cross and rose again to save me. Please forgive me, wash me clean, and fill me with Your Holy Spirit. I choose to follow You alone. Thank You for loving me and setting me free. Amen.”**

No matter where you’ve been or what you’ve done, Jesus loves you and wants a real relationship with you. You don’t have to stay trapped in deception. He’s waiting with open arms.

**Need prayer or someone to talk to?** Reach out. You’re not alone.
