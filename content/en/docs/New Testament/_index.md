## Welcome to the New Testament – King James Version (KJV)

Explore the complete **New Testament** of the **King James Version (KJV)** — book by book, chapter by chapter.

The **KJV**, first published in 1611, remains one of the most cherished and influential translations of the Holy Bible. Known for its poetic language, spiritual clarity, and deep theological impact, it has guided believers in faith, worship, and devotion for generations.

At *The Living Directory*, this sacred text forms the foundation of our **devotionals** and **guided journals**, such as *Focus Through Stillness* and *Twelve Graces*. Each book and verse is an invitation to pause, reflect, and grow in the presence of God.

This edition is presented from the public domain and carefully sourced via [Archive.org](https://archive.org). We've formatted it for easy reading and daily engagement—whether you’re journaling, studying, or simply seeking the peace of Scripture.
