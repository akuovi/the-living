In a world buzzing with distractions, reclaiming your focus isn’t just about productivity—it’s about living with purpose, clarity, and faith.

I learned this the hard way one quiet morning while staring at a blank page for my book, *Focus Through Stillness*. Notifications pinged, emails piled up, and my thoughts scattered. That’s when I began practicing what I now call **“Focus Work”**—purpose-driven attention that aligns our efforts with our values and calling.

> **Colossians 3:23**  
> *"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord."*

## 🔹 1. RescueTime – See Where Your Time Really Goes  
I was shocked when RescueTime emailed me and told me I was spending more time on distractions than **85% of people** that week! Social media, news, and entertainment were eating up precious hours without me even realizing it. That’s when I decided to take control of my time.

**Why I love it:**
- Productivity Pulse to measure focus  
- Blocks distracting websites  
- Offline time tracking  
- Privacy-first (data stays local)  

🕊️ **Spiritual Benefit:** Encourages better stewardship of time (*Proverbs 21:5*).

## 🔹 2. FocusMe – A Digital Coach for Self-Discipline  
Sometimes willpower isn’t enough. FocusMe locks down distractions—even if you try to override it. It’s been a game-changer during tough deadlines or low-energy days when I’m tempted to escape into distractions.

**Standout tools:**
- Force Mode to block apps/sites  
- Pomodoro Timer for structured focus  
- Habit tracking to build discipline  

🕊️ **Spiritual Benefit:** Supports self-control, a fruit of the Spirit (*Galatians 5:22–23*).

## 🔹 3. Toggl Track – Track Time with Intention  
When I want to consciously shape my day, Toggl is my go-to. One click starts a timer. I use it to log writing, prayer, study, and breaks. It’s simple but incredibly grounding.

**Why it works:**
- Calendar view of your time  
- Idle detection  
- Syncs with Google Calendar & more  

🕊️ **Spiritual Benefit:** Promotes mindfulness and helps us “redeem the time” (*Ephesians 5:16*).

## ✨ Final Thought  
Focus isn’t about hustle—it’s about **alignment**.  
Using these tools, I’ve created space for peace, creativity, and presence. I believe God honors intentional effort, especially when we quiet the noise and listen for His leading.
