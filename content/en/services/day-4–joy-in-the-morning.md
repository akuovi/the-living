The night doesn’t last forever. No matter how long the darkness lingers, the morning will come — and with it, joy.

> _"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning."_ — Psalm 30:5

You are not forgotten in the shadow. Joy is closer than you know.

## Reflection

When have you seen God bring beauty out of brokenness? Recall a season where joy surprised you after sorrow. What does that memory stir in your heart today?

_Journal prompt:_  
**Where am I being invited to hope again — even if I don't feel ready?**

## Scripture

- **Nehemiah 8:10** – _"The joy of the Lord is your strength."_

**Lord of Light,**  
Shine joy into my weary places.

Remind me that joy is my inheritance in You.  
Amen.

Joy doesn't deny sorrow — it outlasts it.
