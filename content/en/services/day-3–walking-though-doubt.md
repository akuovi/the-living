Faith doesn’t mean never questioning — it means bringing our questions to God. He is not intimidated by our doubt. He meets us in it.

> _"Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."_ — Mark 9:24

This space invites honesty. Let your doubt become a doorway to deeper faith.

## Reflection

What are you wrestling with right now? God welcomes your honest heart. When has He shown Himself faithful, even when you weren’t sure?

_Journal prompt:_  
**What doubts or questions do I need to bring to God today — without shame or fear?**

## Scripture

- **James 1:5-6** – _"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God..."_
- **Hebrews 11:1** – _"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for..."_
- **Jude 1:22** – _"And of some have compassion, making a difference."_

_Which verse comforts or challenges you most today?_

## Prayer

**God,**  
Thank You for being patient with my doubts.  
I bring them to You — not to fix, but to hold.  
Grow my trust in the mystery of Your ways.  
Amen.

Doubt isn’t the end of faith — it’s often the beginning of a deeper one.
