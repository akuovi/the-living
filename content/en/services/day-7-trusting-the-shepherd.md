We don’t need to know every step — we just need to know the Shepherd. He goes before us, beside us, and behind us.

> _"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."_ — Psalm 23:1

This is your reminder: You are being led by love.

## Reflection

Where do you feel lost or unsure? How would it feel to truly trust that God is guiding your path?

_Journal prompt:_  
**What is one decision or direction I need to place under the Shepherd’s care today?**

## Scripture

- **Psalm 23:3** – _"He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness..."_
- **John 10:4** – _"The sheep follow him: for they know his voice."_
- **Isaiah 58:11** – _"The Lord shall guide thee continually..."_

_Pray through one of these slowly. Let it guide your trust._

## Prayer

**Good Shepherd,**  
I don’t need to know the way — I just need to follow You.  
Lead me gently. Speak clearly.  
Help me to trust more than I fear.  
Amen.

Trust grows one step at a time — and you're not walking alone.
