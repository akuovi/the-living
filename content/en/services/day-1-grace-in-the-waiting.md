Sometimes God’s grace isn’t loud — it’s quiet and hidden in the pause. In those in-between places, His love holds us steady.

> _"Be still, and know that I am God."_ — Psalm 46:10

Let this entry be a gentle reminder: waiting is not wasted when God is in it.

## Reflection

When has a delay in your life turned into a hidden gift? Reflect on how God used a “wait” to grow your faith, soften your heart, or redirect your path.

_Journal prompt:_  
**Where is God asking me to wait with trust today? What grace is available in this moment?**

## Scripture

- **Isaiah 40:31** – _"But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength..."_
- **Lamentations 3:25** – _"The Lord is good unto them that wait for him..."_
- **Psalm 130:5** – _"I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait..."_

_Sit with one verse. How does it speak into your situation right now?_

## Prayer

**Lord,**  
Help me to wait well.  
Quiet the rush in me and remind me that You are working, even when I can’t see.  
Let grace fill the space between question and answer.  
Amen.

## You are not forgotten in the waiting. Grace is near, even now.
