In a world that pushes for more, God invites us into less — less noise, less rush, more soul.

> _"In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and confidence shall be your strength."_ — Isaiah 30:15

Today, breathe deeply. Let simplicity speak.

## Reflection

Busyness often crowds out clarity. What simple rhythm, moment, or truth brings peace to your spirit? Where is God inviting you to simplify?

_Journal prompt:_  
**What can I let go of today in order to make room for God's peace?**

## Scripture

- **Psalm 131:2** – _"I have calmed and quieted my soul..."_
- **1 Thessalonians 4:11** – _"Study to be quiet..."_
- **Luke 10:42** – _"One thing is needful..."_

_Which verse invites you into stillness today?_

## Prayer

**Lord of Peace,**  
Quiet the chaos.  
Remind me that You are not found in the noise, but in the still small voice.  
Help me choose what matters.  
Amen.
