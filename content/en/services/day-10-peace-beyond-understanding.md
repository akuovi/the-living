True peace doesn’t come from perfect circumstances. It comes from the presence of a perfect Savior.

> _"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds..."_ — Philippians 4:7

Today, you are invited to rest — even if the storm is still raging.

## Reflection

What are you anxious about today? What would it look like to release that to God and breathe in His peace?

_Journal prompt:_  
**Where do I need peace — not answers — in this moment?**

---

## Scripture

- **John 14:27** – _"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you..."_
- **Isaiah 26:3** – _"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace..."_
- **Colossians 3:15** – _"Let the peace of God rule in your hearts..."_

_Let one of these settle deep in your spirit today._

## Prayer

**Prince of Peace,**  
I surrender my anxious thoughts to You.  
Cover me with the calm that only You can give.  
Help me to trust Your presence more than I fear my problems.  
Amen.

Peace doesn’t always make sense. That’s what makes it holy.
