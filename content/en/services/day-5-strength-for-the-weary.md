Exhaustion isn’t a spiritual failure — it’s a sign to return to your source. God isn’t asking you to run on empty.

> _"He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength."_ — Isaiah 40:29

Today, let this be your permission to pause and draw strength again.

## Reflection

Where do you feel worn down or depleted? Have you been trying to move forward without first being filled?

_Journal prompt:_  
**What areas of my life need God’s strength — not my own striving — today?**

---

## Scripture

- **Matthew 11:28** – _"Come unto me... and I will give you rest."_
- **Psalm 73:26** – _"God is the strength of my heart..."_
- **2 Corinthians 12:9** – _"My strength is made perfect in weakness."_

_Read slowly. Let these words renew you._

## Prayer

**Heavenly Father,**  
I’m tired — and that’s okay.  
Meet me in my weariness with Your steady strength.  
Help me release what was never mine to carry alone.  
Amen.
