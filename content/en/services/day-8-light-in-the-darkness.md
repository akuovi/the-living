The darkness is not the end of the story. Even there, God is present — and His light cannot be overcome.

> _"The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."_ — John 1:5

No matter how dim it feels, His light is still reaching for you.

## Reflection

Think of a time when God’s light broke through your despair or confusion. Where do you need that light now?

_Journal prompt:_  
**What shadows am I walking through — and where do I see even the faintest light?**

---

## Scripture

- **Psalm 18:28** – _"For thou wilt light my candle..."_
- **Isaiah 9:2** – _"The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light..."_
- **John 8:12** – _"I am the light of the world..."_

_Read these as a declaration. What does God's light reveal to you today?_

## Prayer

**Lord of Light,**  
Shine into the corners of my fear and confusion.  
Remind me that darkness has no power over Your presence.  
Be my clarity, my comfort, and my guiding star.  
Amen.
