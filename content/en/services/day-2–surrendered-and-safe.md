There is peace in letting go. When we release our grip, we find God’s arms already holding us.

> _"Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee."_ — Psalm 55:22

This is a safe space to surrender — your plans, your fears, your striving.

## Reflection

We often cling tightly to control. But surrender isn’t weakness — it’s worship. Reflect on something you’ve been trying to manage on your own. What would it look like to entrust it to God?

_Journal prompt:_  
**What is God inviting me to place in His hands today?**

## Scripture

- **Proverbs 3:5-6** – _"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart..."_
- **Matthew 11:28** – _"Come unto me, all ye that labour..."_
- **Psalm 37:5** – _"Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him..."_

_Meditate on the verse that resonates. Where does it lead your heart?_

## Prayer

**Dear Father,**  
I surrender my fears, my outcomes, my expectations.  
Let Your peace cover me as I let go.  
Teach me to rest in the safety of Your will.  
Amen.

Surrender is sacred. It’s where control ends and faith begins.
